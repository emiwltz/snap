# SNAP Psychometric Thresholds Configuration
# These thresholds determine pass/fail criteria for stability metrics

thresholds:
  # Test-retest reliability (same condition, different runs)
  test_retest:
    minimum: 0.60      # Below this = unstable
    target: 0.70       # Goal for stable profile
    excellent: 0.80    # Highly stable
    metric: pearson_r

  # Inter-paraphrase consistency (same meaning, different wording)
  inter_paraphrase:
    minimum: 0.65
    target: 0.75
    excellent: 0.85
    metric: pearson_r
    description: Correlation across semantic variations

  # Coefficient of variation (response variability)
  cv:
    maximum: 15        # Above this = too variable
    target: 10         # Goal for low variability
    excellent: 5       # Highly consistent
    metric: percentage
    description: Standard deviation / mean * 100

  # Cronbach's alpha (internal consistency)
  cronbach_alpha:
    minimum: 0.65

    target: 0.75
    excellent: 0.85
    metric: icc_2_1     # Two-way random, single measures
    description: Agreement across all sources of variation

  # Effect size for sensitivity analysis
  effect_size:
    minimum: 0.5       # Medium effect
    target: 0.8        # Large effect
    metric: cohens_d

  # Coherence rate (% responses within expected range)
  coherence_rate:
    minimum: 0.50
